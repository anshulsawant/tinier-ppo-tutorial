## 1. General Setup & Common Issues

### How do `config.yaml` and `config_debug.yaml` differ?
*   **`config.yaml` (Main):**
    *   Designed for training a larger, more capable model (e.g., `Qwen/Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat`).
    *   Assumes a CUDA-enabled GPU is available (`training.device: cuda`).
    *   May use settings like `bfloat16` for `model.torch_dtype` and `ppo.use_8bit_adam: true` for memory efficiency on GPUs.
    *   Training parameters (e.g., `total_ppo_steps`) are set for a more substantial training run.
*   **`config_debug.yaml` (Debug):**
    *   Designed for quick testing and debugging, especially if you don't have a powerful GPU.
    *   Uses a much smaller model (e.g., `EventsRLF/tiny-gpt-fast-tokenizer`) that can run on a CPU.
    *   Sets `training.device: cpu` and `model.torch_dtype: float32`.
    *   Disables 8-bit Adam (`ppo.use_8bit_adam: false`).
    *   Uses fewer samples and steps (`training.num_samples`, `training.total_ppo_steps`) for faster execution.
    *   It inherits defaults from `config.yaml` and overrides these specific keys for a CPU-friendly, quick debug setup.

### What if I have CUDA issues or `bitsandbytes` problems?
*   **Switch to CPU Mode:** The easiest workaround is to use the debug configuration:
    ```bash
    python src/ppo_trainer.py --config configs/config_debug.yaml
    ```
    This runs on the CPU and does not use `bitsandbytes`.
*   **CUDA Issues:**
    *   Ensure your NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit version are compatible with the PyTorch version you installed.
    *   Check `nvidia-smi` to see if your GPU is recognized.
    *   You might need to install PyTorch with a specific CUDA version: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cuXYZ` (replace `cuXYZ` with your CUDA version, e.g., `cu118` or `cu121`).
*   **`bitsandbytes` Issues:**
    *   This library is for 8-bit Adam optimization and usually requires a Linux environment with a compatible NVIDIA GPU and CUDA setup.
    *   If `ppo.use_8bit_adam: true` is set but `bitsandbytes` is not correctly installed or incompatible, training might fail.
    *   You can disable it by setting `ppo.use_8bit_adam: false` in your config or via command-line override: `ppo.use_8bit_adam=false`. The standard AdamW optimizer will be used instead.
    *   Consult the `bitsandbytes` GitHub repository for specific installation instructions and troubleshooting.

## 2. Working with Exercises

### Why are there 5 exercises in `ppo_trainer.py`?
These five exercises represent the core components of the PPO algorithm that you need to implement to get the trainer working:
1.  **`compute_policy_loss`:** Calculates the PPO clipped surrogate objective, which drives the learning of the policy (Actor).
2.  **`compute_value_loss`:** Calculates the loss for the value function (Critic), teaching it to better predict future rewards.
3.  **`compute_entropy_loss`:** Calculates the entropy of the policy's action distribution, encouraging exploration.
4.  **`compute_gae_advantages`:** Implements Generalized Advantage Estimation to determine how much better or worse actions were than expected, and to calculate returns (targets for the value function).
5.  **PPO Mini-batch Update Logic (within `run_ppo_update_epoch`):** This is the heart of the learning phase, where you use the outputs of the other functions to perform gradient updates on the model parameters.

Successfully implementing these will give you a functional PPO trainer.

### My exercise implementation isn't working. How can I debug?
1.  **Read the Comments Carefully:** The exercise sections in `src/ppo_trainer.py` have detailed comments and "Steps" to guide you. The "WHY..." sections explain the purpose.
2.  **Use `pytest`:** As detailed in the `README.md`, run `pytest` from the project root. The tests in `tests/test_ppo_trainer.py` are designed to check each exercise function individually using predefined inputs and expected outputs. Failures here will point to specific problems.
3.  **Print Statements/Debugger:** Insert print statements in your code to check the shapes and values of intermediate tensors. For example, in `compute_policy_loss`, print `ratio.shape`, `advantages.shape`, `surr1`, `surr2`, etc. You can also use a Python debugger.
4.  **Compare with Solutions:** If you're stuck, look at the corresponding function in `src/ppo_trainer_solutions.py`. Try to understand the logic there and compare it line-by-line with your attempt.
5.  **Isolate the Problem:** If the full training run fails, try to determine which exercise might be the cause. For example, if you see `NaN` losses, the issue might be in one of the loss functions or GAE.
6.  **Check Tensor Shapes and Devices:** Mismatched tensor shapes or devices are common sources of errors in PyTorch. Use `.shape` and `.device` attributes to verify.

## 3. PPO Algorithm Concepts

### How does training converge if we train the policy and the critic at the same time?
This is a classic question in Actor-Critic methods! Convergence is possible due to several factors:
*   **Shared Goal:** Both Actor (policy) and Critic (value function) aim to maximize cumulative reward. The Critic learns to evaluate states visited by the Actor's current policy, and the Actor uses the Critic's evaluations as a baseline to improve.
*   **Advantage Function:** The Actor learns from the "advantage" ($A(s,a) \approx Q(s,a) - V(s)$), which is the difference between an action's value and the state's baseline value. This is a more stable signal than raw rewards.
*   **PPO Stability Mechanisms:**
    *   **Clipped Surrogate Objective (Policy):** Prevents excessively large policy updates, keeping changes within a "trust region."
    *   **Clipped Value Loss (Critic):** Stabilizes value function updates.
    *   **Multiple Epochs & Sample Reuse:** PPO reuses collected experience for several update epochs, made feasible by the clipping mechanisms.
    *   **KL Penalty (Implicit in Reward):** Discouraging the policy from deviating too much from a reference policy (often the initial policy) by penalizing large KL divergence ($KL(\pi_{\text{actor}} || \pi_{\text{ref}})$) in the reward signal.
    *   **Entropy Bonus:** Encourages exploration, preventing premature convergence to a suboptimal policy.
*   **Interdependent Learning:** They provide learning signals for each other. The Actor's exploration generates data for the Critic; the Critic's improved value estimates provide better baselines for the Actor.

While convergence isn't always guaranteed and depends on hyperparameters, PPO's design promotes more stable learning than simpler Actor-Critic methods.

### Explain the GAE computation in more detail.
Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) is a technique to estimate the advantage function $A(s,a)$ (how much better is action $a$ in state $s$ than the average action from $s$).

**Core Concepts:**
*   **State ($s_t$):** The sequence of tokens generated so far.
*   **Action ($a_t$):** Generating the next token.
*   **Value Function ($V(s_t)$):** Estimated by the Critic (value head); predicts the total expected future discounted reward from state $s_t$.
*   **Reward ($r_t$):**
    *   In this tutorial, the primary reward is the `final_reward` (e.g., 1.0 for a correct GSM8K answer), given at the end of the sequence.
    *   A `kl_penalty_t` is applied at each step: `kl_coeff * (logprob_actor(a_t|s_t) - logprob_ref(a_t|s_t))`.
    *   The `token_level_rewards` in the code are mostly `-kl_penalty_t`, with `final_reward - kl_penalty_{T-1}` at the last step.

**Why GAE?**
*   **TD Error ($\delta_t$):** $ \delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t) $. This is a one-step advantage estimate. Low variance but potentially biased if $V$ is inaccurate.
*   **Monte Carlo Return ($G_t$):** $ G_t = \sum_{k=t}^{T-1} \gamma^{k-t} r_k $. The advantage is $G_t - V(s_t)$. Unbiased but high variance.
*   **GAE Formula:** GAE balances this trade-off using a parameter $\lambda$:
    $ A_t^{\text{GAE}} = \sum_{l=0}^{T-1-t} (\gamma \lambda)^l \delta_{t+l} $
    This is an exponentially weighted average of future TD errors.
    *   If $\lambda = 0$, $A_t^{\text{GAE}} = \delta_t$ (TD error).
    *   If $\lambda = 1$, $A_t^{\text{GAE}}$ is similar to the Monte Carlo advantage (unbiased, high variance).

**Why Compute in Reverse?**
The GAE sum can be computed efficiently using a recursive formula:
$ A_t = \delta_t + \gamma \lambda A_{t+1} $
(where $A_T = 0$ by convention, and the mask ensures $A_{t+1}$ is zero if $s_{t+1}$ is a padded/terminal state).
To use this, we start from $A_{T-1}$ and work backward to $A_0$. This is why the code iterates `for t in reversed(range(response_length))`. The `last_gae_lam` variable in the code stores $A_{t+1}$ from the previous iteration (or 0 for the first iteration $t=T-1$).

### Why does the Monte Carlo method have high variance?
High variance in Monte Carlo returns ($G_t = \sum_{k=t}^{T-1} \gamma^{k-t} r_k$) occurs because $G_t$ depends on the *entire sequence of actions and rewards* from step $t$ until the episode ends.
1.  **Stochasticity:** Both the policy (action selection) and the environment (state transitions, rewards) can be random.
2.  **Compounding Randomness:** A single different action or transition early on can lead to a vastly different future trajectory and thus a very different $G_t$.
3.  **Summation Accumulates Variance:** The variance of each step's reward/transition accumulates in the sum. Longer episodes mean more opportunities for divergence.

This means $G_t$ can vary wildly for the same starting state $s_t$ across different rollouts, making the learning signal noisy.

### What is the `returns` calculated in GAE implementation?
The `returns` calculated at the end of `compute_gae_advantages` (via `returns = advantages + values`) are the **target values for training the value function (Critic)**.
*   The value function $V(s_t)$ aims to predict the expected total discounted future reward from state $s_t$.
*   The GAE advantage $A_t$ estimates how much *better or worse* the actual outcome was compared to the initial value estimate $V(s_t)$.
*   So, `returns_t = A_t + V(s_t)` is an improved, empirically-derived estimate of the total discounted reward-to-go from state $s_t$.
The value loss then aims to minimize the difference between the Critic's new predictions $V_{\text{new}}(s_t)$ and these `returns_t` targets.

### Why are `advantages` whitened at the end of GAE?
"Whitening" normalizes the advantages across the batch to have approximately **zero mean and unit standard deviation**. This is done using the `masked_whiten` function.
1.  **Stabilizing Policy Updates:** Raw advantages can have arbitrary scales. Large advantages can lead to unstable policy updates. Normalization brings them to a consistent scale.
2.  **Consistent Gradient Scale:** Helps maintain a more consistent scale for policy gradients, making learning less sensitive to reward magnitudes and potentially simplifying hyperparameter tuning.
3.  **Improved Learning Dynamics:** Empirically found to improve stability and sample efficiency. It prioritizes the *direction* of the update over the potentially noisy *magnitude* of raw advantages.

### Why do we need a value estimate for each token?
In PPO for sequence generation, a value estimate $V(s_t)$ for each token position (state $s_t$) is crucial:
1.  **Estimating Future Rewards:** $V(s_t)$ estimates the total expected future reward from the state *after* generating token $t-1$ (and before generating token $t$).
2.  **Calculating Advantages (GAE):** GAE relies on TD errors ($\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$), which explicitly require $V(s_t)$ and $V(s_{t+1})$ for each step $t$. Without per-token values, these cannot be computed.
3.  **Temporal Credit Assignment:** Per-token values help assign credit or blame to individual token choices within a sequence, allowing for more fine-grained policy updates.
4.  **Compatibility:** Standard PPO implementations for sequence tasks (like Hugging Face TRL) expect per-token values.

The model first produces values for all tokens, and then appropriate slicing (e.g., `values[:, prompt_len - 1: ...]`) is done during loss calculation to focus on the response part.

### Does it make sense to iterate over a single set of rollouts multiple times during PPO updates?
**Yes, absolutely.** This is a core feature of PPO, controlled by `ppo.epochs`.
1.  **Sample Efficiency:** Generating rollouts is expensive. Reusing the same rollout data for multiple update epochs allows the algorithm to extract more learning signal from each batch of experience.
2.  **PPO's Clipping Mechanism:** The clipping in the policy and value loss functions prevents updates from being too large relative to the policy that generated the data. This makes it feasible to reuse data for several epochs without causing excessive divergence due_to the data becoming "off-policy."

Typically, `ppo.epochs` is a small number (e.g., 2-10) to balance improved sample efficiency with the risk of data becoming too stale.

## 4. Model & Architecture

### What is `ActorModelWithValueHead` (formerly `AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead`)?
`ActorModelWithValueHead` is a custom `nn.Module` used in this tutorial. It:
1.  **Wraps a Base LLM:** It takes a standard pre-trained Hugging Face transformer model (e.g., loaded with `AutoModelForCausalLM`) as its `base_model`.
2.  **Adds a Value Head:** It adds a separate linear layer (`self.value_head`) on top of the `base_model`.
3.  **Actor-Critic Functionality:**
    *   The **Actor** is the `base_model` itself, which produces logits for token generation (the policy).
    *   The **Critic** is the `value_head`, which takes hidden states from the `base_model` and outputs a scalar value estimate (expected future reward).
4.  **Forward Pass:** A forward pass through `ActorModelWithValueHead` returns both the `logits` from the base LLM and the `values` from the value head.
5.  **Convenience:** This structure simplifies managing the Actor and Critic within a single object while allowing them to share the same base transformer weights, which is parameter-efficient.

### Does the value head need to be configured? What type of architecture does it have?
*   **Configuration:**
    *   In this tutorial, the `value_head` is initialized as a simple `nn.Linear` layer without special configuration beyond its input/output dimensions. Its weights are initialized normally.
    *   More advanced libraries like `trl` might offer options for initialization strategy or dropout for the value head if it were more complex.
*   **Architecture:**
    *   It's typically a **single linear layer**.
    *   **Input:** Takes the last hidden state from the base transformer model (shape: `batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size`).
    *   **Output:** Projects these hidden states to a single scalar value for each token position (shape: `batch_size, seq_len`).

### Is it standard practice in RLHF for LLMs to share the base model for policy and value function?
**Yes, it is very common practice.**
*   **How:** A pre-trained LLM serves as the base. Its language modeling head provides the policy (Actor). A separate, small value head (usually a linear layer) is added on top of this base model to serve as the value function (Critic). The underlying transformer blocks and embeddings are shared.
*   **Why:**
    *   **Parameter Efficiency:** Significantly reduces memory and computation compared to training two separate large models.
    *   **Representation Sharing:** Both policy and value tasks can benefit from shared representations learned by the base model.
*   **Examples:** This approach is common in many open-source RLHF implementations (e.g., using Hugging Face `trl`) and is likely used in large models like Llama 2-Chat and early versions of ChatGPT for efficiency.
*   **Alternatives:** While less common for large models, some research explores separate networks or different architectures. Newer methods like DPO bypass the need for an explicit value function network during RL.

## 5. Implementation Details

### Do we use label masking for this training? Is it necessary?
Yes, the script uses `response_mask`, and it's necessary.
1.  **What is `response_mask`?** It identifies which tokens in the `full_ids` (prompt + response) belong to the actual generated `response_ids`, excluding padding tokens.
2.  **Purpose (similar to Label Masking in SFT):**
    *   In PPO, losses (policy, value, entropy) should only be calculated over the tokens generated by the current policy (the response).
    *   The `response_mask` ensures that prompt tokens and padding tokens do not contribute to these loss calculations.
3.  **Why Necessary?**
    *   **Correct Objective:** The policy learns from actions it took (generated tokens). Including prompt tokens (which are fixed inputs) in PPO losses would be incorrect.
    *   **Meaningful Gradients:** Gradients should only come from parts of the sequence the policy influenced.
    *   **Accurate Statistics:** Metrics like KL divergence or clip fractions would be skewed if calculated over non-response tokens.

### Why do we take tokens from `(prompt_len - 1) : (prompt_len + resp_len - 1)` for responses?
This slicing extracts the logits and values relevant to predicting the response tokens.
Let the combined sequence be `[P_0, ..., P_{p-1}, R_0, ..., R_{r-1}]` (p=prompt_len, r=resp_len).
*   **Logits for `R_t`:** The logits used to predict token `R_t` (at index `p+t` in the full sequence) are generated from the hidden state *after* processing the preceding token (at index `p+t-1`).
*   **Value for state before `R_t`:** The value $V(s)$ for the state *before* generating token `R_t` is associated with the hidden state *after* processing the token at index `p+t-1`.

So, for the first response token `R_0` (at index `p`):
*   Logits are from index `p-1`.
*   Value is from index `p-1`.
For the last response token `R_{r-1}` (at index `p+r-1`):
*   Logits are from index `p+r-2`.
*   Value is from index `p+r-2`.

The Python slice `[prompt_len - 1 : prompt_len + resp_len - 1]` correctly selects the range of indices from `p-1` up to, but not including, `p+r-1`. This covers all states *preceding* each response token generation.

### What is the difference and connection between `batch_size` and `mini_batch_size`?
*   **`ppo.batch_size` (Rollout Batch Size):**
    *   Used in `perform_rollouts`.
    *   Controls how many prompts are processed in parallel during **experience generation** (model inference, `model.generate`).
    *   Limited by GPU memory for inference.
*   **`ppo.mini_batch_size` (Update Mini-Batch Size):**
    *   Used in `run_ppo_update_epoch`.
    *   Controls how many samples from the collected `rollout_buffer` are used in a **single forward/backward pass during model updates**.
    *   Limited by GPU memory for training (forward, backward, activations).
*   **Connection:**
    *   `perform_rollouts` (using `ppo.batch_size`) generates a large buffer of total samples.
    *   `run_ppo_update_epoch` iterates over this buffer in smaller chunks of `ppo.mini_batch_size` for multiple epochs.
    *   `ppo.mini_batch_size` is typically smaller than the total samples collected and can be independent of `ppo.batch_size`.
    *   Effective update batch size (for optimizer step) = `ppo.mini_batch_size * cfg.ppo.gradient_accumulation_steps`.

## 6. Understanding Key Hyperparameters

### What's the role of `kl_coeff` and how does it affect training?
*   **Role:** `kl_coeff` (Kullback-Leibler coefficient) controls the strength of a penalty applied to discourage the learned policy (Actor) from diverging too far from a reference policy (usually the initial, pre-trained model or a frozen copy).
*   **Calculation:** The KL divergence $KL(\pi_{\text{actor}} || \pi_{\text{ref}})$ measures this difference. The penalty is `kl_coeff * KL_divergence_per_token`. In this code, this penalty is subtracted from the task reward *before* GAE calculation.
*   **Effect on Training:**
    *   **High `kl_coeff`:** Strongly penalizes deviations. The policy will stay very close to the reference model. This can prevent catastrophic forgetting or exploitation of reward model flaws but might also limit how much the policy can improve on the task.
    *   **Low `kl_coeff`:** Allows the policy to deviate more significantly. This can lead to faster learning on the target task but risks instability or moving into undesirable policy regions if the reward signal is noisy or misspecified.
    *   It's a crucial hyperparameter for stabilizing RLHF and ensuring the model doesn't drift too much in undesirable ways.

### What's the role of `entropy_coeff`? How is entropy computed?
*   **Entropy Computation:**
    1.  **Probabilities:** For each token position, logits from the policy are converted to probabilities using softmax: $p_i = \exp(z_i) / \sum_j \exp(z_j)$.
    2.  **Shannon Entropy:** $H(p) = - \sum_i p_i \log(p_i)$.
*   **Role of `entropy_coeff`:**
    *   In PPO, an "entropy bonus" is added to the objective, meaning we *minimize negative entropy*. `entropy_coeff` is the weight of this term.
    *   **Encourages Exploration:** Maximizing entropy makes the policy's probability distribution flatter (less certain). This encourages trying different actions (tokens), preventing premature convergence to a suboptimal or deterministic strategy.
    *   **Prevents Policy Collapse:** Helps avoid the policy becoming too confident (low entropy) too quickly, especially early in training.
*   **Effect:**
    *   **High `entropy_coeff`:** Promotes more exploration, potentially slowing down convergence on the main task but leading to more robust solutions.
    *   **Low `entropy_coeff`:** Less exploration. The policy might converge faster but could get stuck in local optima.

### What do `clip_ratio` (for policy) and `clip_range_value` (for value loss) do?
These are PPO's core clipping mechanisms for stability:
*   **`clip_ratio` (Policy Loss, $\epsilon$ in PPO papers):**
    *   Used in `compute_policy_loss`.
    *   The probability ratio $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}$ measures how much the policy has changed.
    *   The surrogate objective is clipped: $L^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t [\min(r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t)]$.
    *   **Role:** It limits how much the policy can be updated in a single step, preventing destructively large updates even if advantages are high. This keeps the new policy within a "trust region" of the old policy.
*   **`clip_range_value` (Value Loss):**
    *   Used in `compute_value_loss`.
    *   The value function's prediction $V_{\text{new}}$ is clipped relative to the old value $V_{\text{old}}$ from the rollout: $V_{\text{clipped}} = V_{\text{old}} + \text{clamp}(V_{\text{new}} - V_{\text{old}}, -\text{clip\_range\_value}, \text{clip\_range\_value})$.
    *   The value loss then uses $\max((V_{\text{new}} - \text{Returns})^2, (V_{\text{clipped}} - \text{Returns})^2)$.
    *   **Role:** Prevents the value function from changing too drastically based on potentially noisy return estimates from a single batch, stabilizing its learning.

## 7. Dataset

### Why use the GSM8K dataset for this tutorial?
The GSM8K (Grade School Math) dataset is chosen for several reasons:
1.  **Clear Task & Reward:** The task is to solve math word problems, which have verifiable, unique numerical answers. This allows for a straightforward reward signal: 1.0 for a correct answer, 0 or a small partial reward (0.1 in this tutorial for correct format) otherwise.
2.  **Reasoning Challenge:** GSM8K problems require multi-step reasoning, making it a good benchmark for testing and improving an LLM's problem-solving capabilities beyond simple pattern matching.
3.  **Manageable Complexity for a Tutorial:** While challenging, it's more contained than open-ended dialogue or creative writing, making it suitable for a focused tutorial on RL mechanics.
4.  **Availability:** It's a publicly available dataset.

## 8. Interpreting Metrics & Troubleshooting

### Should one skip a PPO update if rollout rewards are sparse?
Generally, **no**. PPO updates are still valuable even with zero task rewards in a given step because:
1.  **Value Function Learning:** The value function learns from `returns = advantages + values`. Even with zero `final_rewards`, `returns` can be non-zero due to future value estimates and KL penalties, providing a learning signal.
2.  **KL Penalty Signal:** The KL penalty (`kl_penalties` subtracted from rewards) guides the policy to stay near the reference model, which is important for stability.
3.  **Learning from Negative Advantage:** Negative advantages (e.g., due to high KL or poor value estimates) still provide gradients to steer the policy away from undesirable actions.
4.  **Entropy Bonus:** Encourages exploration independently of the reward.

### How do I know that training is converging? What are good trends?
*   **`rollout/reward_mean` (Most Important):** Should **increase** and eventually **plateau**. This indicates the model is getting better at the task. *Note: This may not increase significantly for the first tens or even hundreds of steps as the value function improves and the policy is more exploratory (due to entropy loss and initial KL divergence).*
*   **`loss/value`:** Should **decrease and stabilize** at a low value, showing the Critic is accurately predicting returns.
*   **`params/approx_kl`:** Should remain **relatively small and stable**. Large or consistently growing KL can indicate instability. `kl_coeff` helps manage this.
*   **`loss/policy`:** Can fluctuate but shouldn't diverge. Its sign depends on advantages.
*   **`loss/entropy` (Negative Entropy):** The value logged is often negative entropy. If so, it might decrease (entropy itself increases, more exploration) initially, then increase (entropy decreases, policy becomes more confident). If positive entropy is logged, it should decrease over time.
*   **Clip Fractions (`params/policy_clip_frac`, `params/value_clip_frac`):** Should be **low** (e.g., < 0.1 or 0.2). High values suggest updates are too aggressive and are being heavily clipped, indicating potential instability.
*   **`params/grad_norm`:** The gradient norm *before* clipping. If this is consistently very high (e.g., > 10-100) when `max_grad_norm` is set to ~1.0, it indicates unstable gradients. The actual norm applied to the optimizer step will be the clipped one.
*   **Qualitative Evaluation:** Periodically check the actual model outputs for sample prompts.

**Good Convergence:** Reward plateaus at a satisfactory level, value loss is low and stable, KL is bounded, clip fractions are low.

### Why is randomization important during actor model generation for rollouts?
While greedy decoding might give better immediate answers, randomization (sampling) during rollouts is for **exploration and effective learning**:
1.  **Exploration:** Allows the model to discover diverse sequences and potentially better solutions it wouldn't find with a deterministic policy.
2.  **Better Value Estimation:** Exposes the Critic to a wider variety of states, helping it learn a more robust value function.
3.  **Avoiding Policy Collapse:** Prevents the policy from quickly converging to a narrow, suboptimal strategy. The entropy bonus also aids this.
4.  **More Realistic Training Data:** Generates data more representative of the stochastic policy being learned.

The goal of rollouts isn't just immediate success but gathering diverse experiences for robust learning.

### My `loss/total` is decreasing, but other metrics look problematic (high `policy_clip_frac`, high `grad_norm`). What's happening?
This scenario, as detailed in Q&A 16 from the original context, often indicates **unstable training despite a decreasing total loss.**
*   **High `policy_clip_frac` (e.g., > 0.5):** Means a large percentage of your policy updates are being drastically limited. The policy is trying to make changes much larger than `clip_ratio` allows. This suggests instability.
*   **High `grad_norm` (before clipping):** Indicates that the raw gradients are very large ("exploding gradients"). While gradient clipping (e.g., to `max_grad_norm=1.0`) prevents these large values from directly updating the model, their existence points to numerical instability in the loss landscape or updates.
*   **Constant `loss/value`:** If the value loss isn't decreasing, the Critic isn't learning, leading to poor advantage estimates that can cause the policy updates to be erratic.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **Reduce Learning Rate (`ppo.learning_rate`):** This is often the first step.
2.  **Check `kl_coeff`:** Ensure it's reasonably set. Too low might let the policy diverge too fast.
3.  **Verify GAE/Value Loss Implementation:** Ensure correctness if you've modified them.
4.  **Ensure Gradient Clipping is Active:** `ppo.max_grad_norm` should be set (e.g., 1.0).

Focus on stabilizing updates (low clip fractions, controlled pre-clip grad norms) before optimizing for reward.

## 9. Interpreting Outputs

### What should I look for in the `outputs/` directory?
The `training.output_dir` (e.g., `outputs/ppo_gsm8k_model/`) will contain:
*   **`effective_config.yaml`:** A copy of the exact configuration used for that run, including all defaults, merges, and command-line overrides. This is crucial for reproducibility.
*   **Checkpoint Directories (e.g., `step_10/`, `step_20/`):**
    *   Saved periodically according to `training.save_interval`.
    *   Each contains the weights of the `ActorModelWithValueHead` (which includes the base LLM and the value head) and the tokenizer files.
    *   You can resume training from these or use them for intermediate evaluations.
*   **`final/` Directory:**
    *   Contains the final trained model and tokenizer after all `training.total_ppo_steps` are completed.
*   **Log Files (if configured):** Depending on your logging setup (e.g., if Python's `logging` module is configured to write to a file, or if using tools like `wandb` which have their own logging directories).

This directory is key for tracking your experiments, saving your trained models, and debugging.The `FAQ.md` has been successfully updated with the new structure, refined content, and additional Q&A sections as planned.

Here's a summary of the changes:
1.  **Reorganization and Structure:**

    *   Created a Table of Contents at the top for easy navigation.
    *   Ordered categories and questions for a more natural learning flow.

2.  **Refinement of Existing Content:**
    *   Reviewed and edited existing Q&As for clarity, conciseness, accuracy, and formatting (e.g., breaking down long answers, using bullet points).
    *   Ensured consistent terminology with `README.md` and the codebase.
    *   Question 7 (GAE): Clarified KL penalty notation to $KL(\pi_{\text{actor}} || \pi_{\text{ref}})$.
